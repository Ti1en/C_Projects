# C_Projects

## Overview

In this repository I store a collection of projects and programs written in the C programming language. 

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of each project currently in the repository:

### 1. Matrix Operations
- **Description**: This program performs various matrix operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition.
- **Key Concepts**: Arrays, functions, loops.

### 2. Huffman Coding
- **Description**: Implementation of Huffman Coding algorithm for data compression and decompression.
- **Key Concepts**: Data compression, binary trees, priority queues.

### 3. Snake Game
- **Description**: A simple terminal-based version of the classic Snake game.
- **Key Concepts**: Game loop, keyboard input handling, 2D array manipulation.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you will need a C compiler like GCC. Clone this repository and compile each project using your C compiler.

For example, to compile and run the Snake game:

```bash
gcc Snake.c -o Snake
./Snake
